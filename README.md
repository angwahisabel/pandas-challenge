# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a study on school performance based on various factors such as school size, spending per student, and school type. The analysis explores the relationship between these factors and academic performance metrics like average math scores and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, passing reading, and the overall passing rate.
